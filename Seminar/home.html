    <h1>Some of our games</h1>
    <br>
    <h3>Rock paper scissors</h3>
      <br>
      <a href="rps.html" >
        <img src="rps.png"alt="rock paper scissors"height="200px" width="200px" class="center">
      </a>
      <br>
      <p>A simultaneous, zero-sum game, it has three possible outcomes: a draw, a win or a loss. A player who decides to play rock will beat another player who has chosen scissors ("rock crushes scissors" or "breaks scissors" or sometimes "blunts scissors"), but will lose to one who has played paper ("paper covers rock"); a play of paper will lose to a play of scissors ("scissors cuts paper").</p>
      <p>Rock Paper Scissors is often used as a fair choosing method between two people, similar to coin flipping, drawing straws, or throwing dice in order to settle a dispute or make an unbiased group decision. Unlike truly random selection methods, however, rock paper scissors can be played with a degree of skill by recognizing and exploiting non-random behavior in opponents.</p>
      <br>
      <h3>Connect 4</h3>
      <br>
      <a href="connect4.html" >
        <img src="c4.png" alt="connect 4" height="200px" width="200px" class="center">
      </a>
      <br>
      <p>Connect 4 is a two-player connection board game, in which the players choose a color and then take turns dropping colored tokens into a seven-column, six-row vertically suspended grid. The pieces fall straight down, occupying the lowest available space within the column. The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own tokens. Connect Four is a solved game. The first player can always win by playing the right moves.</p>
      <h3>Block jumper</h3>
      <br>
      <a href="index.html" >
        <img src="dino.png" alt="dinosaur game" height="200px" width="200px" class="center">
      </a>
      <br>
      <p>The player guides a block across a side-scrolling obstacle course, avoiding obstacles to achieve a higher score.</p>

      <br>
      <h3>Animator</h3>
      <br>

They typically specialize in one of these media and may further concentrate on a specific area, such as characters, scenery, or background design.</p>
